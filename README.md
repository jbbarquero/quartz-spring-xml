Project for testing Quartz 2.2.1 with Spring 3.2.6.RELEASE
- The main purpose is to see how the new "Factory" classes solve the problem for Spring and the new Quartz classes from version 2.0 onwards:
· org.springframework.scheduling.quartz.JobDetailFactoryBean
· org.springframework.scheduling.quartz.CronTriggerFactoryBean
· org.springframework.scheduling.quartz.SchedulerFactoryBean
